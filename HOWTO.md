# How to deploy your project's web site

(In the following instructions we assume that your project is called
'Apache Foo'; search and replace with your actual project name.)

## Setup

1. `cd site`
2. svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/foo/site target
3. `sudo apt-get install rubygems ruby2.1-dev zlib1g-dev` (linux)
4. `sudo gem install bundler github-pages jekyll`
5. `bundle install`

## Add javadoc

If your project supports javadoc, you can copy the generated javadoc
into svn each time you need to re-generate.

1. `cd ..`
2. `mvn -DskipTests site`
3. `mv target/site/apidocs site/target`

## Running locally

Before opening a pull request, you can preview your contributions by
running from within the directory:

1. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Pushing to site

1. `cd site/target`
2. `svn status`
3. You'll need to `svn add` any new files
4. `svn ci`

Within a few minutes, svnpubsub should kick in and you'll be able to
see the results at
[foo.apache.org](https://foo.apache.org/).

## Adding contributors

To add a contributor to the project, or to modify existing contributors,
edit `site/_data/contributors.yml`.
The [project members]([http://localhost:4000/community.html#project-members]
list will re-generate.
