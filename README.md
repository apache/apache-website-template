# Apache Website Template

This project contains a template web site, generated using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To use it, copy the `site` directory into your project.  You must also
include licensing information from the `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files in
your own project. And, we suggest that you include the
[HOWTO](HOWTO.md) instructions to allow your committers to modify and deploy the site.

You can see an example of the site at
[apache-website-template.hydromatic.net](https://apache-website-template.hydromatic.net/).
